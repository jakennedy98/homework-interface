# Homework Interface

For my LSAT instructor position, I wanted a way to create assingments for my students.

This application allows me to create articles, videos, flashcard sets, and quizzes, and assign them to specific students. The quiz data is stored and analytics are given based on the user's performance.

Skills used:

- Django (Django REST Framework)Javascript
- PostgreSQLReact
